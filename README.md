# 🚦 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

This Power BI project provides a comprehensive analysis of road accident data. The dashboard visualizes key insights related to accident frequency, severity, vehicle types, states, and time-based patterns to support data-driven decisions for traffic safety improvements.

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights

- **Total Records Analyzed:** 20,000+ accident entries  
- **Interactive Visuals:**  
  - State-wise accident distribution  
  - Vehicle-type vs. accident severity matrix  
  - Time-of-day accident trends  
  - Seasonal and monthly breakdowns  
  - High-risk zones and heatmaps

- **Filters & Slicers:**  
  Users can dynamically filter by state, vehicle type, accident severity, and year to explore patterns and derive insights.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI** – Data visualization and interactive reporting  
- **Power Query** – Data cleaning and transformation  
- **DAX** – KPI calculations and measure logic  
- **Microsoft Excel** – Source data preparation

## 📈 Key Outcomes

- Identified peak hours and days for accidents to help with traffic regulation planning  
- Highlighted high-risk states and vehicle categories involved in major accidents  
- Provided actionable insights that can assist authorities in reducing accident rates

## 📁 File Structure

- `Road Accident.pbix` – Power BI dashboard file  
- `Road Accident Data.xlsx` – Raw dataset used for analysis  
- `README.md` – Project overview and documentation

## 🔍 Insights Snapshot

> 🕒 Most accidents occur between 4 PM – 8 PM  
> 🚗 Two-wheelers are involved in the highest number of accidents  
## 📌 Future Enhancements
